		<main class="tips">
			
			<p>During the event . . .</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Take notes and collect data! You shouldn’t wait to create the report until the end of the event. Also you don’t want to have to rely on your memory.</li> 
				<li>Take lots of pictures!!!! Take more pictures than you think you need, you'll love to have options later. Pictures of what? Faces, makes, conversations, gestures, walls, people who give testimonials, facilitators and obviously a group pic! Please note that pictures showing engagement are more motivating than selfies.</li>
				<li>Record testimonials: Shoot videos or record voices of the participants and capture their impressions: what they’ve liked? what would they change? what they’ve learnt? how can they apply it in their life/jobs? Always keep in mind the objective of the event.</li>
				<li>Also try to get written quotes. Ask participants for testimonials before they leave, or to post something to your event’s social media page.</li>
			<li>Shoot behind-the-scenes videos: of how you’re setting up or running the event.</li>
			<li>Statistics and demographics: collect this info using an online survey. This will help you to build an infographic.</li>
			<li>Ask for feedback: it is very useful to ask for feedback on an on-line forum. That would help to have the opinions written so you can read them patiently after the event.</li>
			<li>Collect twitter accounts: you can use a #hashtag to let you know who is participating and who to follow, ask them to start following your Club on Twitter, or just write their handles on sticky notes and collect them during the event.</li>
