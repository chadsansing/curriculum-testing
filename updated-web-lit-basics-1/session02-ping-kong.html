            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Ask learners, "How do you get to the Internet?"</p>
            
            <p>Take a few ideas from the group, then explain the following:</p>
            
            <img src="http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/internetvstheweb.jpg" wifth="90%" alt="An image of a graphic showing the internet connected to a desktop computer"><br><br>
            
            <blockquote>The "Internet" is a system of networks and the "Web" sits on top of the Internet and provides an interface for viewing and interacting with the information stored in various computers around the world.</blockquote><br>
            
            <p>Further explain that:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Anytime you ask the Internet to do something, whether by entering a URL into a browser or watching a video on YouTube, your internet request "hops" through several network devices, like routers and switches and servers, on its way from your computer to the websiteâ€™s server.</blockquote><br>
            
            <p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwyJGzZmBe8">introductory video</a> (also linked from this picture) to give learners a little more context before starting the obstacle course:</p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Perform the Net</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Form small improv groups of 4-5 actors. Get together and brainstorm a way to perform how the Internet works. Think about how to use your space - you can perform anywhere there's room in the space around you and spread out and move around as much as you'd like. Think about the materials around you and grab any props that might help you show the Net at work.</p>
            
            <p>Perform your skits for one another. Applaud your heart out for the other groups. Laugh and cheer at especially great moments of Performing the Net history!</p>

          <li>
            <h1>Set Up the Obstacle Course</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

            <p>Explain to the group that in order to help understand this path, we're going to <astrong>act out a human ping/traceroute in an obstacle course</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>We'll travel from a i) local computer through ii) a LAN to the iii) Internet to get to iv) Google.com or the website of your choice.</p>

            <p>Ask the group to <strong>gather underneath the "My computer" sign</strong> and ask for <strong>three volunteers</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Hand three of the volunteers the signs labeled <strong>"Hop 1: Local Router," "Hop 2: Internet Service Provider and "Hop 3: The Website Company's Router"</strong> and ask them to spread out throughout the room.</p>
            
            <p>Explain that the <strong>signs represent different "hops"</strong> that an Internet request must go through before it gets to the website a user is looking for. The <strong>rest of the students</strong> are packets of computer code trying to get to the website at the other end of the room.</p>

          <li>
            <h1>Model the Obstacle Course</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p><strong>Choose one of these "packet" students to act as a model</strong> for the rest of the group before they all start the activity.</p>
            
            <p>Give the learners the following scenario:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Iâ€™m at my computer and I decide to watch a video on YouTube. After I type in the web address, my computer converts "youtube.com" into a code that all computers can read and then divides that code into several internet "packets". This volunteer student represents one of those packets.</blockquote><br><br>
            
            <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8233430584_ce59b4a546_b.jpg" width="90%" alt="An image of teachers and students modeling the obstacle course"><br><br>
            
            <h2>Hop 1: Local Router</h2>

            <p>Ask the example student to walk to the "Hop 1: Local Router" and explain:</p>

            <blockuote>First the packet will hop through local network devices like routers, switches or modems in your building. The local network devices then send the packet to the Internet.</blockuote><br><br>

            <h2>Hop 2: Internet Service Provider</h2>

            <p>Have the student walk to and explain the next hop:</p>

            <blockuote>After a packet gets here, to the Internet service provider, it is sent all the way to one of YouTubeâ€™s routers.</blockuote><br><br>

            <h2>Hop 3: Company Router</h2>

            <blockquote>Once the packet gets through YouTube's router, it is sent to a computer in the company's headquarters that will stream my video.</blockquote><br><br>

            <h2>Website</h2>

            <blockuote>In order to get the video to stream on my computer, YouTubeâ€™s computer converts my video into packets too, which travel all the way back to my computer on the same path of network devices it took to get to YouTube.</blockuote><br><br>

            <p><stong>Ask the example student to walk back to you</strong>, making sure to pause at each hop on the way back.</p>
            
            <h2>IP Addresses</h2>

           <p> When the student returns, ask if anyone knows how the devices at each hop know exactly where to send a packet. If no one knows, explain:</p>

            <blockuote>They use IP addresses! Every device or computer in a network or online has an IP (or "Internet Protocol") address. Itâ€™s like a home address - and it helps devices find each other and communicate. IP addresses have 4 sets of numbers in a string like this: 172.168.3.12</blockuote><br><br>

           <h2>In Between Hops</h2>

           <p> To make the obstacle course more interesting, you might place "government spies" between hops. This resource from the EFF explains how third parties might intercept data between hops. Talk with your learners about what data is protected, what's vulnerable, and to whom.</p>


          </li> <!-- end of step-->
          
          <li>
            <h1>Off to the Races</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Now it's time for everyone to try the obstacle course!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Explain to the students that they are all "packets"</strong> trying to make their way to Google.com (or the website you chose) to complete someoneâ€™s Internet request. They must stop at each "hop" before moving on to the next one.</p>
            
            <p><strong>But wait, there's a twist!</strong> Before the packets can get from one hop to the next, they must complete a quick challenge posed by the student acting as the Hop. <em>Examples: Do 5 jumping jacks! Sing "Happy Birthday" etc.</em></p>
            
            <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8233430386_45a5aba09a_b.jpg" width="90%" alt="An image of students running the obstacle course"><br><br>
            
            <p>When the packet completes the Hop's challenge, the Hop will allow the packet to move the next location until the packets reach "The Website".</p>
            
            <p>Ask the packets to form a single-file line and move through the obstacle course as quick as they can! You can have someone time how long it takes everyone to get through the course to see who makes it the fastest.</p>
            
            <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8207/8233430120_ea0c7fc7fa_b.jpg" width="90%" alt="An image of educators watching students run the osbtacle course"><br><br>

          <li>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

            <p>After all learners have completed the obstacle course, show them just how quickly packets are able to move through the the Internet in real life.</p>
            
            <p><em>If you don't have internet connectivity or are short on time, skip the Ping Utility exercise.</em></p>
            
            <p>Ask the group some reflective questions like:</p>
            
            <ul clas="fancy">
              <li>How long did it take you to get all the way from the computer through the Internet to the website?</li>
              <li>Do you think a computer moves faster through the Internet than you did?</li>
              <li>What happens on the Internet when you type a Web address and hit enter?</li>
              <li>What are the "parts" of the Internet?</li>
              <li>How do large amounts of information ever make it through low-bandwidth parts of the Net?</li>
              <li>What's the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Take a few guesses and then explain that we can actually tell exactly how long a real request takes by using the Ping utility in the Command Prompt (PC) or Terminal (Mac). Or if you are offline, just explain what would happen.</p>
            
            <p><code>Ping is a function on computers that lets you check to see if your computer can connect to another computer over the network or online by sending a â€˜packetâ€™ of data to it and seeing how long it takes for the packet to come back.</code></p>
            
            <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8233431352_d817e553fa_b.jpg" width="90%" alt="An image of a teacher leadeing a conversatipn with students"><br><br>
            
            <p>Ask students to make specific guesses/bets for how long it will take for 5 packets to ping Google and come back. Write down their guesses on the wall.</p>
            
            <p>Either in groups (if equipment is available) or as one group looking at the projector, run the ping utility on google.com (use the tip sheet for instructions!).</p>
            
            <p>Discuss the results.</p>
