		<h1>CSS Fonts: Movie Poster Extension</h1>
		
		<p>Something has gone wrong in the movie studio marketing department. A designer has chosen a font for the science-fiction film <em>Bridge to Infinity</em> that just doesn't match the movie's genre and big ideas. Can you use freely available webfonts, like those from <a href="https://google.com/fonts">Google</a>, to fix this design mistake before the movie's release?</p>
		
		<p>To do so, you'll need to use what you already know about design and webfonts to:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Draw your own conclusions about the movie's genre and big ideas from its title and tagline.</li>
			<li>Find the lines of code in <code>index.html</code> and <code>style.css</code> that link to the mistmatched font used on the page right now.</li>
			<li>Find a freely available webfont online that fits the movie's genre and big ideas.</li>
			<li>Link that webfont to your <code>index.html</code> and <code>style.css</code> files.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Good luck. Drawing on your past work in this CSS module, you can do this!</p>

		<h4>Secret missions!</h4>
		
		<p>Use this template to create your own movie poster with a title, background image, and font that all support one another thematically! Change the copy above and below the title, as well, to make the poster all your own.</p>
