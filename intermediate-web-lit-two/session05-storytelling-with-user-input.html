            <h1>1. Preparation</h1>

            <p>
              Work through <a href="storytelling-with-user-input-1.html">today's activity</a> to get a feel for how each of its parts - the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - looks and for how those parts work together. Review this lesson plan, as well, to make sure you're comfortable facilitating it.</p>
			  
			  <p>Be sure to read through the lesson so you can familairize yourself with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/My_first_HTML_form"><code>form</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"><code>input</code></a> elements of a webpage. These fields let users submit information to scripts and databases from webpages.
			
			<p>You don't need to be an expert on webforms to teach this lesson. Just be able to explain that forms and inputs let users send information from a webpage to a program or service somewhere else on the web.</p>
			
			<p>
				Be sure to test your technology and Internet connectivity.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Come up with an equitable way for your learners to form pairs.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Create a class account or several accounts for students to use on <a href="https://thimble,mozilla.org">Thimble</a>, Mozilla's online coee editor, and post the URL, or a shortened link, for today's project somewhere highly visible in the learning space.

              Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
              Fusce ipsum erat, pretium eu tempor in, aliquam non dui.

            <h1>3. Rewriting Stories and Prompts for User Input</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Ask learners to hit the "Remix" button in the upper right-hand corner of <a href="storytelling-with-user-input-1.html">today's activity page</a>. This will take them into <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org">Thimble</a>, Mozilla's online code editor.</p>
			
			<p>Inside Thimble, learners can see the code for the webpage itself (<code>index.html</code>), as well as the CSS stylesheet (<code>style.css</code>) and JavaScript code (<code>script.js</code>) for the page. Those files are accessible in the left-hand FILES sidebar and can be edited in the central column of the page. A preview of what the webpage will look like when published is over on the right.</p>
			
			<p>At this point, ask learners to log-in to Thimble using their accounts or a class account you provide.</p>
			
			<p>Notice that the preview pane also has a "Tutorial" tab above it. Click on this tab to show learners the tutorial and then work through it with the group, inviting students who feel comfortable doing so to work ahead.</p>
			
			<p>This tutorial will take learners through searching for their images and swapping them into the JavaScript code included in the project.</p>
			
			<p>Syntax and punctuation will be especially important today, so help students place their semi-colons and quotation marks when they have trouble.</p>
			
			<p>Once you and your learners have gone through the tutorial, ask them to hit "Publish" in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. This will give them a URL they can use to visit their own versions of this page and they can share the URL with friends and family, as well.</p>
			
			<p>Give learners a few minutes to visit each other's computers and to test their forms and inputs stories. Then ask them to gether together again to debrief on the lesson.</p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->
		  
          <li>
            <h1>4. Reflection and Assessment</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

            <p>At the end of the lesson, use questions like these (or make your own!) to facilitate a brief, reflective discussion of the day's work.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>In your own words, how do the <code>form</code> and <code>input</code> elements work with buttons and scripts?</li>
				<li>How else could people use webforms?</li>
				<li>What are some privacy, safety, and security concerns you could imagine having with forms that send information online?</li>
				<li>What are some similarities and differences between this lesson and our previous ones?</li>
				<li>How can creativity and humor show up in code?</li>
				<li>How would this lesson have been different if you had to write it from scratch instead of remixing it?</li>
				<li>What seemed easiest about today's work? Most difficult? Why?</li>
				<li>How would you improve this lesson or project?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>You can record learners' responses for the purpose of assessment, as well, but be sure to do so in a way that doesn't disadvantage those who struggle with composing in any particular medium. For example, be ready to record spoken answers, as well as to read typed or written responses.</p>
