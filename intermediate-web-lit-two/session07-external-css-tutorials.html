              <h3>Selecting Favorite Foods</h3>

              <p>Welcome students to today's activity and explain that we'll be using online, game-like CSS tutorials to learnnew ways to organize webpages and style their elements.</p>
			  
			  <p>First. we're going to practice sorting our favorite foods using multiple, overlapping categories as a way to conceptualize using multiple, specific CSS selectors all at once. Then we'll try to fit all of our favorite foods on to a plat using flexible layout as a way to think of the principles behind the <code>flexbox</code> layout properties we'll learn in one of today's tutorials.</p>
			  
			  <p>Invite students to share their favorite foods with the class. Make a visible list on a large piece of paper, a whiteboard, or a shared document on your projected computer. Try to come up with a large list in under five minutes.</p>
			  
			  <p>Once you have a list of several foods, ask students how they would select as many alike foods as possible using a mix of general and specific labels. How could they capture several foods at once with just a handul of selectors (or descriptions)? Start with 'Food' as an umbrella category and then asl students to come up with a handful of selectors that describe as many favorite foods as possible.</p>
			  
			  <p>For example, if students came up with a list like this...</p>
			  
			  <p>
				  <ul>
					  <li><code>Chocolate bars</code></li>
					  <li><code>Orange chicken</code></li>
					  <li><code>Potato chips (or crisps)</code></li>
					  <li><code>Edamame</code></li>
					  <li><code>Mofongo</code></li>
				  </ul>
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>...you might all together come up with a series of selectors like <code>food sweet</code> to cover <code>chocolate bars</code>, <code>mofongo</code>, and <code>orange chicken</code> and another series of selectors like <code>food not-meat savory</code> to cover <code>potato chips (or crisps)</code> and <code>edamame</code>.</p>
			  
			  <p>Have students generate several series of selectors or ways to categorize several foods at once. Take up to 10 minutes for this part of the activity.</p>
			  
			  <p>Once once you have 5 or more series of selectors, pass out the <a href="https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/21636/">empty plate template</a>. Ask students to pick their favorite series of selectors and to fit all the foods inside of it on the plate. Also ask students to label their plates with their series of selectors. Tell them that the idea is to think of the plate as a webpage and the arrangement of their foods as the layout of that page.</p>

              <p>Finally, ask students to post their plates in a shared space in the classroom and to see how their peers arranged their foods on thier plates according to the available space and the food selectors they used for the activity. Accompany students on a brief gallery walk before they take their seats at computers.</p>

                  min</p>
              </div><!-- ADD DETAILS OF THE INTRODUCTION TO YOUR SESSION -->

              <h3>Playing the Tutorials</h3>
			  
			  <p>After students settle at their computers, introduce them to today's tutorials on your projected computer and make sure every student can get to both sites.</p>
			  
			  <p>
				  <ul>
					  <li>CSS Diner - <a href="http://flukeout.github.io/">http://flukeout.github.io/</a></li>
					  <li>Flexbox Froggy - <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">http://flexboxfroggy.com/</a></li>
				  </ul>
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>Explain that today's we'll look at how we can use CSS to select very specific parts of a page for styling, as well as to select multiple parts of a page at once. We'll also play around with <code>flexbox</code> layout selectors which can help us make flowing, dynamic (or flexible) layouts that are difficult to do with other positioning properties.</p>
			  
			  <p>Briefly work through a few levels of each tutorial on a projected computer to demo they work. Invite students to come up with solutions for the early levels of the games. Then let students work alone or in pairs for about a half hour. Tell them that the goal is to make it through both tutorials in that time, but that there will be places where each of us gets stuck - it's not a problem to ask for help or to run out of time today.</p>
			  
          </div>

        </li>
		
          <li>
            <div>
              <div class="time">
                <p>5<br>
                  min</p>
              </div><!-- ADD DETAILS OF THE INTRODUCTION TO YOUR SESSION -->

              <h3>Reflection and Assessment</h3>

              <p>After spending about 35 minutes on the tutorials, bring students back together as a group and facilitate a brief, reflective conversation about today's work. Make a list of your own questions or ask questions like those suggested below.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you have time, consider asking students to write, type, or otherwise record their responses for self-assessment and teacher evaluation. Just be sure to match recording technologies to students' needs so that whatever medium (or media) you chose for (or with) the group isn't a barrier to learners' expression.</p>

              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>What did you pick up and learn about CSS today that you didn't know before?</li>
				<li>How would you explain the relationships between CSS selectors, properties, and values in your own words?</li>
				<li>How would you summarize the way HTML and CSS work together?</li>
				<li>How would you explain <code>flexbox</code> layout?</li>
				<li>How did working through these external, game-like tutorials compare to other web literacy lessons you did?</li>
				<li>If you were able to create a tutorial game to teach a part of HTML or CSS, what would it be like? What would it teach?</li>
				<li>Are there activities you've completed in Thimble that you'd like to try re-styling with <code>flexbox</code> instead of <code>position</code> or <code>float</code>? Which activities? Why do you think <code>flexbox</code> would work well on them?</li>
				<li>What seemed easiest about today's work? Most difficult? Why?</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
