            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            
            <p>Review <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/chadsansing/81417/">the rules of the game</a> and familiarize yourself with the prompts you're going to use with your community.</p>
            
            <p>Decide on how you'll play the game. Will you use a deck of cards with prompts or titles on them? Will you use an onlien generator? Will judges tell their own stories each round?</p>
            
            <p>Localize the game for your community. If you plan to use a deck of cards, make those cards before you play unless you decide that your players should make the deck together during the activity. If you plan to use an online generator like <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/chadsansing/81417/">this one</a>, be sure to customize the prompts so they make sense to your audience. If you want your judges to tell their own stories, be sure to add in extra time for playing the game.</p>

          <li>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Gather your learners together in a storytelling circle. Explain that today we're going to play a game about solving problems with the web. First, though, we're going to think about how the web might have solved a problem or two in our own lives. The big idea is to figure out why the web matters and how it can be used for more than apps.</p>
            
            <p>Tell your learners a brief story about a time in your life when you ran into a tough problem that the web could have solved for you. For example, you might say something like this:</p>
            
             <blockquote>When I was a small child, I once mistook someone else for my father at the market. It was very embarassing. I wish I had the web back then so I could have tracked where my father was and went to him instead.</blockquote>
            
            <p>Next, give learners about 3-5 minutes to think of a similar story. Invite them to use a prompt or stem like this:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Once I ____________________. I wish I had the web so that ___________________.</blockquote>
              
              <p><strong>If your community has limited access to the web or your learners don't know too much about it</strong>, you can change the prompt to be about technology or tools in general; ask participants to describe a problem that a piece of technology or a tool could have helped them solve if only they had it at the time.</p>
              
              <p>Take another 5 minutes for learners to share their stories with a neighbor to the right or left. Then, ask a few volunteers to share their stories with the whole group before moving on to the game.</p>
              

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Play the Game</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>
            
            <p><em>What If They Had the Web?</em> is a group story-telling game. It works like this:</p>
              
              <ol class="fancy">
                <li>First, you appoint a judge.</li>
                <li>Then the judge picks a prompt or tells a story.</li>
                <li>Next, the other players each come up with a web-based solution to the problem in the story.</li>
                <li>The judge listens to each solution and awards a point to the player with the best one.</li>
                <li>Whoever gets the point is the judge for the next round.</li>
                <li>The game keeps going until someone gets five points and wins the game.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>You can play with a deck of cards with prompts and titles on them. You can use or create an online prompt generator like <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/chadsansing/81417/">this one</a>. You can also invite judges to tell their own stories each round or to summarize a popular story for their audience.</p>
              
              <p>You can use this game as an introductory icebreaker activity before another web literacy lesson or module if you think your audience has a basic understanding of the web and the kinds of things we can do with it.</p>
              
              <p><strong>If your audience in new to the web or has very little background knowledge about it</strong> you can also</p>
              
              <ul class="fancy">
                <li>Save this game for the end of a lesson or module on web literacy and play when you learners have a better idea of what the web can and can't do.</li>
                <li>Change the game to something like <em>What If They Had the Right Technology?</em> or <em>What If They Had the Right Tool?</em></li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>The big idea is to think of how technologies and tools, including the web, are relevant to our lives and can help us do more than buy apps.</p>
			
          </li> <!-- end of step-->
		  
          <li>
            <h1>Localize the Game</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>

            <p>Invite your learners to visit <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/chadsansing/81417/">this Thimble project</a> to localize the game for their friends, families, and communities.</p>
            
            <p>After your participants have the chance to click the button on that web page a few times to see how it works, ask them to hit the "Remix" button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. This will take them into Thimble, Mozilla's online code editor, so they can edit the code of the webpage.</p>
            
            <p>Ask learners to click on the file called <code>tutorial.html</code> in the FILES sidebar on the left-hand side of the Thimble interface. The tutorial will take learners through changing the prompts and titles on the webpage. Learners will edit the JavaScript (.js) file called <code>script.js</code> and replace the prompts and titles there with conflicts and stories from their own experiences and communities.</p>
            
            <p>Walk through the tutorial with any learners who need a bit of help and show them how to localize the page with new prompts.</p>
            
            <p>After learners have localized the game, tell them to hit "Publish" in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. After adding a description for their project, each learner will get a new URL, or web address, for their finished project. They can click on the URL to visit their new page and share its address with others.</p>
            
            <p>Once everyone has had the chance to publish their copy of the game in Thimble, let your participants visit one another's computers or webpages to see how their peers changed the activity.</p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->
		  
          <li>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <p>Take the last few minutes of the activity to reflect with your learners. You can create your own questions or use questions like these:</p>
                
                <ul class="fancy">
                  <li>What connections do you see between the web and the problems we face in our communities, media, and pouplar stories?</li>
                  <li>What are some of the things the web can help us do besides use the apps and services we already have?</li>
                  <li>What seemed easiest in today's activity? What seemed most difficult? Why?</li>
                  <li>How did you localize the game for your friends, family, or community? What changes did you make to the game? Why did you make them?</li>
                  <li>What did you learn about coding from this activity?</li>
                  <li>How would you summarize the connections between the project's webpage, its stylesheet, and its javascript?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You can also use questions like these - or your own questions - to assess participants' learning. Just be ready to capture learners' responses in a variety of ways so each everyone can express themselves fully regardless of any difficulties they experience with one medium or another such as hand-writing or public speaking.</p>
