  <h1>What if they had the web?</h1>

  <ol id="rules">
    <li>Appoint a judge.</li>
    <li>Pick a prompt or tell a story. You might have a deck of cards with prompts, a website that generates them, or judges who tell stories from their own cultures and experiences.</li>
    <li>Everyone but the judge should come up with their best web-based solutions to a conflict in each story. </li>
    <li>The judge awards a point to the player with the best solution.</li>
    <li>Whoever wins the point becomes the next judge.</li>
    <li>The game goes on until one player wins five points.</li>
  </ol>
