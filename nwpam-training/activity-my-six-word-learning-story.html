					 <p>You may also wish to set up an account on <a

					 <p><a

					this definition of the word "Remix"</a>, so that you can help your learners (and

					 <p>Post the URL, or Web address, of today's make somewhere highly visible in your
					room. You may want to post it as a shortened link using a service like <a

		 			   <h3>Introduction and Storyboarding</h3>

					   <p>Welcome your learners and explain that in this activity we're going to tell six-word stories about our learning so far today. We'll use the Web to reflect on our learning in writing, keeping in mind questions like these:</p>

		 				<p><ul>

		 				   <li>What makes for powerful learning?</li> 
						   <li>What are some of the most powerful learning experiences you've had? Why did they work so well for you?</li> 
						   <li>How can Web technologies and Open practices add to or amplify the reach of experiences like those?</li>

		 				</ul></p>
						
						<p>Hand out <a href="">storyboarding templates</a> for the activity. One side of the template is for drafting a six-word story and the other is for drawing or describing an image to go with the story.</p>

						  <p>Ask learners to complete each side of the organizer so that they have a six-word story about today's learning and a quick sketch or written description of a picture that they want to use with their story.</p>

	ACTIVITY -->

	 						 <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>

	 						<p>Ask participants to raise their hands if they know what HTML is. Working with any responses, explain that</p>

							<p><ul>

								<li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard language for web pages.</li> 
								<li>HTML tags - which show up between pointy brackets <code>< ></code> - tell your web browser how to translate the code into the website that Internet users will see. For instance, HTML tags can tell your browser when to turn text into a link, or how big to make the words appear on the page.</li>
								<li>An open tag, like <code>p</code> for paragraph tells the webpage where an element or part of the page begins, while a closed tag, like <code>/p</code>, tells the webpage where that part of the page stops.</li>

	 					   </ul></p>
						   
						   <p>On your projector, go to today's activity in <a href="https://thimb;e.mozilla.org">Thimble</a>, Mozilla's online code editor. Click on "Remix" in the upper right-hand corner of the page to see its code. Show participants the side of the screen with HTML in the file called <code>index.html</code>. Ask participants if any of them can identify a tag.</p>

	 				  </div>

				  </li>


					  <li> <div> <div class="time"> <p>20<br> min</p> </div><!-- ADD DETAILS OF YOUR MAIN ACTIVITY -->

						  <h3>Remix the make</h3>

						  <p>Post the link to <a href="https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/19450/">today's activity</a> and ask learners to go to that website.</p>

						  <p>Invite them to hit the 'Remix' button.</p>

						  <p>After learners hit 'Remix,' they will go into the Thimble interface. They will see HTML code on the left and a live-view of the webpage made from that codee on the right. They can click on the "Tutorial" pane above the live-view on the right to find step-by-step instructions for remixing the webpage.</p>

						  <p>You can also do a 'think-aloud' and remix the page yourself on the computer connected to your projector. Learners who might like more support than the tutorial offers - or learners who learn best by listening instead of reading - might appreciate that level of support from you.</p>
						  
						  <p>Learners will</p>
						  
						  <p>
							  <ol>
								  <li>Change the text of the story.</li>
								  <li>Change the background images of the webpage.</li>
								  
							  </ol>
							  
						  </p>
						  
						  <p>After about 15 minutes, once everyone has had a chance to remix the page, invite your learners to hit the 'Publish' button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Thimble will give them a URL, or Web address, to visit and share with table mates, facilitators, and friends.</p>

					  <h3>Share and Reflect</h3>
					  
					  <p>Encourage participants to pass their machines around the table so they can read one another's remixes. After a few minutes, gather the group's attention back for a brief reflective conversation using questions like these</p>

	 				<p><ul>

	 					<li>How is telling a six-word story similar to or different from telling a longer one?</li> 
						<li>How do media like images or sound files add to a story?</li> 
						<li>How did changing part of the code change part of your story?</li>
						<li>What was it like to start with someone else's story to remix? How was it different from beginning a story on your own?</li>
						<li>What was it like to hit 'publish' and share your story online?</li>
