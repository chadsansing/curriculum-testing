							<h3>Preparation</h3>
							
							<p>Familiarize yourself with how the Internet works using an activity like <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session01-pingkong.html">Ping Kong</a>.</p>
							
							<p>Think about how you will explain IP addresses to young children. Think of websites like houses tnat have addresses on particular streets (networks) and in neighborhoods (countries).</p>
							
							<p>Think also of how you can explain the way information moves across the Internet from one computer to another in "hops." Maybe you can write a slide-deck that's like a children's book explaining how bunnies make the Internet work by hopping from computer to computer with videos of carrots.</p>

                            <h3>Getting Ready for IP Hopscotch</h3>
							
							<p>Gather your kids together and tell them your IP address story. Then explain that today we're going to be like pieces of information hopping around the Internet from our computers to our favorite websites and back again.</p>
							
							<p>Afer that...</p>
							
							<ol>
								<li>Ask your students to share their favorite websites.</li>
								
								<li>Make a big, easily visible list of students' favorite websites.</li>
								
								<li>Show learners how to use a web service or the Ping command on console or terminal to find that website's IP addess.</li>
								
								<li>Explain that information hops from computer to computer when it goes across the Internet, like someone playing hopscotch or pretending to be a bunny.</li>
								
							</ol>

							  <h3>Playing IP Hopscotch</h3>
							  
							  <p>Take your class or club outside to a blacktop playground or other safe place kids can draw their hopscotch grids. Bring the chalk!</p>
							  
							  <p>Once you're outside...</p>
							  
							  <ol>
								  
								  <li>Have learners draw hopscotch grids using the numbers from their favorite sites' IP addresses.</li>
								  
								  <li>Ask learners to play hopscotch on their grids and to act out their favorite website or video when they make it all the way back home.</li>

									  <p>Gather outside or bring your group back to its learning space to talk. Ask learners to explain how they were like Internet while they played IP hopscotch.</p>
