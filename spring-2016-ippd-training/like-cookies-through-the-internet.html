			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			
			<p>In <em>Like Cookies through the Internet</em>, players trade away pretend pieces of private information for online apps and rewards. Players spend their pretend private information like cash to buy the apps and rewards they want. Each 'purchase' also comes with a number of first- and third-party cookies.</p>
			
			<p>Cookies are snippets of code that let their authors follow people and keep track of where they go and whay they do online.</p>
			
			<p>First-party cookies come from developers watching their own sites and services. Third-party cookies come from outside companies watching online traffic.</p>
			
			<p>For example, Company A may use first-party cookies on its own website to find out what its users like to do online. Company B, a company that studies our online habits, might pay Company A to use its third-party cookies, as well. If Company A agrees to take Company B's money and to add its cookies to their site, then Company B can learn about Company A's customers and sell their information to advertisers.</p>
			
			<p>Some companies don't seel the information they collect with cookies. Instead they use it to analyze their work and improve it for users.</p>
			
			<p>Cookies are a big business, though, because they let companies know our business as individuals and as large demographic groups. When a company knows where we go online and what we like and dislike (or what we buy or don't buy) they can develop advertisements and products designed to grab our attention and money.</p>
			
			<p>In this game, we're going to look at just how much we're willing to pay to get the apps and rewards that make our lives more convenient, but less private.</p>

			<h3>How to Set-up</h3>
			
			<p>To play <em>Like Cookies through the Internet</em>, you need</p>
			
			<ul>
				
				<li>A facilitator (<em>that's you!</em>) and a group of players. (In a large group, you may want to form smaller groups for play and discussion.)</li>
				<li>This set of rules.</li>
				<li>A <a href="like-cookies-through-the-internet-scorecard.html">scorecard</a> for each player.</li>
				<li>A set of reflective questions (like the ones provided below) to discuss after the game.</li>
				<li>Optional: edible cookies or edible cookie substitutes (or stickers or tokens that represent cookies).</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<p>Essentially, once you've prepared your follow-up questions and each player has a scorecard, you're ready to play.</p>
			
		</section>
		
		<section id="how-to-play">
			
			<h3>How to Play</h3>
			
			<p>Each game of <em>Like Cookies through the Internet</em> consists of 5-10 rounds of play. The facilitator should decixe on the number of turns per game based on how big the group of players is. It's probably best to play fewer rounds with larger groups than with smaller ones.</p>
			
			<p>During each turn, the facilitator names a service and announces its cost and the number of first- and third-party cookies that come with it.</p>
			
			<p>For example, reading from the chart below, the facilitator would say something like,</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>'The first service for sale is Private Text Messaging.'</li>
				<li>'To get this service, you have to give up your phone number and your contact list.'</li>
				<li>'This service comes with one first-party cookie and no third-party cookies.'</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Here is a turn-by-turn table for the facilitator to use that matches players' scorecards. By clicking the green remic button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, you can use Mozilla's online code editor, <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org">Thimble</a>, to remix this table, as well as the scorecard template, to create your own list of services, costs, and cookies.</p>
			
			<!--Build table here!-->
			
			<p>Next, each player decides whether or not to buy that service and marks her decision on her scorecard.</p>
			
			<p>After that, each player calculates her privacy score for the round and writes it down at the end of the appropriate row on the scorecard.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Each service is worth +1 privacy point.</li>
				<li>Each first-party cookie is worth -1 privacy point.</li>
				<li>Each thrid-party cookie is worth -2 privacy points.</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<p>If you have edible cookies, edible substitutes, or ineedible tokens, you can pass them out each round and give each player the number of 'cookies' that they earned that round.</p>
				
		</section>
		
		<section id="how-to-win">
		
			<h3>How to Win</h3>
			
			<p>At the end of the game, each player tallies her privacy points and write the total at the bottom of her scorecard.</p>
			
			<p>The player with the lowest score wins. Everyone who played can eat and/or share any edible cookiers or edible cookie substitutes (or trade stickers or tokens or other substitutes).</p>
			
			<p>As players eat their cookies (or not), facilitate a brief conversaton around questions like these (or come up with questions of your own). Yould customize the questions for your audience.</p>
			
			<h4>Reflection Prompts</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>What does 'free' actuall mean when it comes to cookies and tracking?</li>
				<li>Why do you think its valuable for developers and advertisers to know our online habits?</li>
				<li>What seems like a good balance between online privacy and convenience? What kinds of information do you feel sharing when you sign up for an app or service or when you know a cookie will follow you?</li>
				<li>What are some ways that apps, services, websites, and other companies incentive us - or reward us - for giving them information?</li>
				<li>Is convenience worth more than privacy? Why or why not?</li>
				<li>What are some advantages and disadvantages of losing privacy online?</li>
				<li>What do you think are some strong provacy habits we could all practice online?</li>
				<li>Can you think of as time when you know  you were beign tracked online because of the ads you saw or the texts or emails you received?</li>
				<li>Do people know about cookies and the cost of 'free' services that take away your online privacy? Should they? How much does privacy matter online?</li>
				<li>Should companies be able to collect information about you and trade it? Why or why not?</li>
				<li>What would the Internet be like if companies could not track you or study your behavior? Would you like that Internet?</li>
				<li>How can people learn about and better understand privacy issues online? How would you teach someone about this topic?</li>
			</ul>

If you buy this service, you get one first-party cookie and three third-party cookies.'</li>
				<li>Each player marks her scorecord to indicate whether or not she bought the service.</li>
				<li>Each player records her score for the turn.</li>
