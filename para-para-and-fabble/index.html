                  <h3>Introduction</h3>

                  <!--Here you can encourage other teachers to try your lesson 
and/or project first by prodividing a link to it. Add your 
link after href=.-->

                  <p>Are you running a community event where you want to teach some animation skills? Do you want to help learners of all ages begin to share their work in the open on the Web? This kit can help! Learners will use <a href="http://parapara.mozlabs.jp/">Para Para</a> and <a href="http://fabble.cc/">Fabble</a>, from <a href=\"http://en.mozillafactory.org/tagged/COMOZILLA">Mozilla Japan</a>, to create and share animations and project ideas in open, collaborative ways.</p>
				  <p>Para Para allows individuals to create short, multi-frame animations that will play against the backdrop of a collaborative wall. Fabble lets users share 'recipes' and 'memos' that document their projects for others to fork and remix.</p>
				  
				  <p>Try each of the activities below on your own and create your collaborative Para Para wall before you begin. Also, try to use Fabble to share a project idea or lesson plan of your own to see how it works.</p>
				  
				  <p><strong>A quick note:</strong> you'll need a Mozilla Persona account to use Para Para (which you can sign up for on the site) and a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account to share projects on Fabble. If you plan to post students' ideas on Fabble, only you need an account. If students want their own Fabble accounts, they need to sign up for GitHub, as well.</p>

                  <!--The next set of instructions is boilerplate copy for teachers 
who want to try the activity. Feel free to edit or delete it 
if it doesn't fit your plan. The link here in line 228 should 
be the same one from line 220.-->

              </div>
            </li>

          <!--Now the individual steps in your lesson begin.-->

          <!--

===========================================================
Each step has the following structure

<li>
<div>

<div class="time">
<p>[Number]<br>
min</p>

<h3>[Name of the step]</h3>

<p>A series of instructions in paragraphs...</p>

<ul>
<li>...and lists.</li>
</ul>

</div>	
</li>

You sould cut and paste that structure and edit it for however many 
steps you have.

Lists can be <ul>, or unordered, with bullet points, or they can be 
<ol>, ordered, with numbers.

Remember you can add links like this:

<a href="[web address]">[name of the webpage]</a>

You can also add images like this:

<img src="[file name or web address]">

To embed media like videos or music, check out the "Share" tabs on 
popular sites like YouTube and Soundcloud.

              <h3>Agenda</h3>

				  <p>Here are the acticvities in this module:</p>
				  	  
				  <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Create a 2D Para Para animation using <a href="para-para-2d.html" target="blank_">this lesson plan.</a> <em>60 minutes</em></li>
                    <li>Create a projection-mapped 3D Para Para animation using this <a href="http://fabble.cc/comozilla/pm-with-parapara#5620b71f6769742ae1b64400" target="blank_">tutorial on Fabble</a>. <em>60 minutes</em></li>
                    <li>Share your own project idea using <a href="http://fabble.cc/fabble/tutorial-en" target="blank_">this Fabble tutorial</a> to create its 'recipe' (steps) and 'memo' (story). <em>60 minutes</em></li>

                  </ol>

		<h3>Assessment &amp; Reflection</h3>

		<p>The activities in this module lend themselves towards all sorts of authentic measures of success. For example, with documentation on your Para Para wall or inside Fabble, it's easy to see</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>Completed animations.</li>
			<li>The number of collaborators on a Para Para wall.</li>
			<li>Completed project recipes and memos.</li>
			<li>The number of likes or members a Fabble project has.</li>
		</ul></p>
		
		<p>In addition to giving learners feedback on their work, you can facilitate reflective conversations about these activities help learners reflect on their own experiences. You can use questions like these to promote discussion or make your own:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What did you learn by creating your animations?</li>
			<li>What problems did you have to solve in creating your animations?</li>
			<li>What was it like to share your animations with thr group on our Para Para wall?</li>
			<li>What was it like to share your project ideas on Fabble?</li>
			<li>What seemed easiest about amking your animations or Fabble recipe?</li>
			<li>What seemed most difficult?</li>
			<li>What were the similarities and differences between your 2D and 3D animations?</li>
			<li>How is making an animation on your computer different from making an animation using your computer, a projector, and real-world objects?</li>
			<li>Why do you think people share their artwork and ideas on the Web?</li>
			<li>Do you think it's better to share your project ideas with others in the open, or to keep your ideas to yourself? Why? Are there times when you would definitely share or not share a project idea?</li>
			<li>Would it be okay with you if someone used your animation or project idea to make something different? Why or why not?</li>
		</ul>
