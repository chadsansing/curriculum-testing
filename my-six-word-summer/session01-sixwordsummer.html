		 			   <h3>Introduction</h3>

					   <p>Have a brief conversation with students and ask them about the highlights of
		summer vacation.</p>

		 				<ul>

		 				   <li>What makes for a good summer vacation?</li> 
						   <li>How is summer vacation better
		and/or worse than school?</li> 
						   <li>What can you learn during vacation outside of
		school that you don’t have time for during the school year?</li>

		 				</ul>

	 					   	<h3>Brainstorm</h3>

	 					   	<p>Ask learners to make a list or map of their summer vacations that retells what
	they did, where they went, and whom they saw.</p>

	 		<p>Towards the end of the 10 minutes, ask students to underline, circle, or
	otherwise mark what’s most important to them on their lists or maps.</p>

	 					   <h3>Stroyboarding</h3>

	 					  <p>Hand out storyboarding templates for the activity. One side of the template is for drafting a story and the other is for drawing or describing an image to go with the story.</p>

						  <p>Ask learners to complete each side of the organizer so that they have a six-wordstory and a quick sketch or written description of a picture that they want to use with their story.</p>

	 						 <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>

	 						<p>Ask participants to raise their hands if they know what HTML is. On your projector, go to any website and right-click to “View Source” to show the HTML code for that page. If you have a participant with HTML experience, ask them to see if they can point out a “Tag” in the code. Make sure to introduce these concepts before starting the activity:</p>

							<ul>

								<li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard language for web pages.</li> 
								<li>HTML tags - which show up between pointy brackets <code>< ></code> - tell your web browser how to translate the code into the website that Internet users will see. For instance, HTML tags can tell your browser when to turn text into a link, or how big to make the words appear on the page.</li>
								<li>An open tag, like <code>p</code> for paragraph tells the webpage where an element or part of the page begins, while a closed tag, like <code>/p</code>, tells the webpage where that part of the page stops.</li>

	 					   </ul>

					  		<h3>Thimble Tour video</H3>

	 						   <p>Explain that Thimble is a tool that will help learners edit HTML to remix webpages for themselves.</p>
							   
							   <p>Project the Thimble tour video so all students can see, or have them watch on their computers. The Thimble tour video is available on thimble.webmaker.org.</p>

	ACTIVITY -->

						  <h3>Remix the make</h3>

						  <p>Post the link to today's make and ask students to go to that website.</p>

						  <p>Invite them to hit the 'Remix' button.</p>

						  <p>After students hit 'Remix,' they will go into the Thimble interface. They will see HTML code on the left and a live-view of the webpage made from that codee on the right. They can click on the 'Tutorial' pane above the live-view on the right to find step-by-step instructions for remixing the webpage.</p>

						  <p>You can also do a 'think-aloud' and remix the page yourself on the computer connected to your projector. Students who might like more support than the tutorial offers - or students who learn best by listening instead of reading - might appreciate that level of support from you.</p>

					  <h3>Share</h3>
					  
					  <p><strong>Publish your remix</strong>. Invite your students to hit the 'Publish'button in the upper right-hand corner of their remix when they finish. Thimble will give them a URL, or Web address, to visit andf share with friends.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Take it a step further</strong>. Invite learners to check out the style.css file in the left sidebar and to see what happens when they change values there.</p>

	 				   <h3>Reflection</h3>
					   
					   <p>Give students about 5 minutes to visit one another's machines or to swap Web addresses to see what other learners came up with in their remixes.</p>
					   
					   
		   			<p>Ask volunteers to share some of their newly remixed stories with the class.</p>
					
					<p>Facilitate a discussion around questions like</p>

	 				<ul>

	 					<li>How is telling a six-word story similar to or different from telling a longer one?</li> 
						<li>How do media like images or sound files add to a story?</li> 
						<li>How did changing part of the code change part of your story?</li>
	<li>What was it like to start with someone else's story to remix? How was it different from beginning a story on your own?</li>
	
						<li>What was it like to hit 'publish' and share your story online?</li>
