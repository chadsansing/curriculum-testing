		<h1>Mozilla Learning Networks<br>
		Contribution Guidelines and Checklist for Community Volunteers</h1>

		<p>To advance our mission of leadership development toward Universal Web Literacy, we want to support you, our community volunteers, in developing lessons and activities localized for your communities’ needs.</p>

		<p>Because of how well you know your learners, you produce excellent, relevant content and curricula. We are thankful that you share it openly and we are always looking for community contributions to curate and spotlight on <a href="https://teach.mozilla.org/activities">teach.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

		<p>As part of that curation process, we want to share with you this set of guidelines (presented as a checklist), so that you know how and why we curate the content that we do.</p>

		<p>This is not a list of hard requirements and it certainly can’t account for all the new, inventive ways you teach others to read, write, and participate on the Web. Instead, it’s an open document meant to help you understand our curation process. If you would like help using this checklist to develop materials, please reach out to us @MozTeach.</p>

		<p>This is also very much a living document, so if you have suggestions for change, please contact <a href="mailto:chad@mozillafoundation.org">chad@mozillafoundation.org</a> or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/chadsansing">@chadsansing</a>.</p>
